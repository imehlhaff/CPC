Description: Implements cluster-polarization coefficient for measuring distributional
	polarization in single or multiple dimensions. Contains support for hierarchical
	clustering, k-means, partitioning around medoids, density-based spatial clustering
        with noise, and manually imposed cluster membership. Calculates CPC and adjusted
        CPC.
